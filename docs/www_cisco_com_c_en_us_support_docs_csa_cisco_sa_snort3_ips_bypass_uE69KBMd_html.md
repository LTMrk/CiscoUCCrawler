### Bias-Free Language
The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## 
Summary 
  * Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured rules on an affected system. 
This vulnerability is due to incorrect HTTP packet handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured IPS rules and allow uninspected traffic onto the network.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
This advisory is available at the following link:  
<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort3-ips-bypass-uE69KBMd>
This advisory is part of the May 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: May 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75298).


## 
Affected Products 
  * ##  Vulnerable Products 
For information about which products were affected by this vulnerability at the time of publication, see the following sections.
### Open Source Snort 3
At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Open Source Snort 3.
For information about which Snort releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/csa/cisco-sa-snort3-ips-bypass-uE69KBMd.html#fs) section of this advisory. For more information on Snort, see the [Snort website](https://www.snort.org/).
### Cisco FirePOWER and Firepower Threat Defense Software 
At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco FirePOWER Services and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 4200 Series Firewalls if they were running Snort 3.
For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software ](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/csa/cisco-sa-snort3-ips-bypass-uE69KBMd.html#fs)section of this advisory. 
**Determine the Snort Configuration on Cisco FTD Software**
On new installations of Cisco FTD Software releases 7.0.0 and later, Snort 3 is running by default. On devices that were running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0 or earlier and were upgraded to Release 7.0.0 or later, Snort 2 is running by default.
To determine if Snort 3 is running on Cisco FTD Software, see [Determine the Active Snort Version that Runs on Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that.html). Snort 3 has to be active for this vulnerability to be exploited.
### Cisco IOS XE Software
At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Unified Threat Defense (UTD) Snort IPS Engine for Cisco IOS XE Software or UTD Engine for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software:
    * 1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)
    * 4000 Series ISRs
    * Catalyst 8000V Edge Software
    * Catalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms
    * Catalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms
    * Catalyst 8500L Edge Platforms
    * Cloud Services Routers 1000V
    * Integrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv)
**Note:** UTD is not installed on these devices by default. If the UTD file is not installed, the device is not vulnerable.
For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-app-bypass-cSBYCATq#fs) section of this advisory. 
**Determine Whether UTD Is Enabled**
To determine whether UTD is enabled on a device, use the **show utd engine standard status** command. If the output shows a **Yes** under **Running** , UTD is enabled. If there is no output, the device is not affected. The following example shows the output on a device that has UTD enabled:
> 
```
Router# **show utd engine standard status **  
> Engine version       : 1.0.19_SV2.9.16.1_XE17.3  
> Profile              : Cloud-Low  
> System memory        :  
>              Usage  : 6.00 %  
>              Status : Green  
> Number of engines    : 1
```
  
>  
```
Engine        **Running**    Health     Reason      
> ===========================================  
> Engine(#1):   **Yes**        Green      None  
> =======================================================  
> .  
> .  
> .
```

### Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software
To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x). This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).
To use the tool, go to the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:
    1. Choose which advisories the tool will search—all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High [Security Impact Rating (SIR)](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr), or only this advisory.
    2. Choose the appropriate software.
    3. Choose the appropriate platform.
    4. Enter a release number—for example, **9.16.2.11** for Cisco ASA Software or **6.6.7** for Cisco FTD Software.
    5. Click **Check**.

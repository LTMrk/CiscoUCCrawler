## 
Summary 
  * A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.
This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming CFSoIP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted CFSoIP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
This advisory is available at the following link:  
<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-cfsoip-dos-tpykyDr>
This advisory is part of the February 2022 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: February 2022 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74834).


## 
Affected Products 
  * ##  Vulnerable Products 
This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and have the CFSoIP feature enabled:
    * Nexus 3000 Series Switches ([CSCvy95696](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy95696))
    * Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode ([CSCvy95696](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy95696))
    * UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCvy95840](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvy95840))
**Note** : For Nexus 3000 and Nexus 9000 Series Switches, CFSoIP is not enabled by default. For UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects, CFSoIP is enabled by default.
### Determine Whether CFSoIP is Enabled
To determine whether CFSoIP is enabled, use the **show cfs status** command on the Cisco NX-OS CLI and check the status of **Distribution over IP**. If **Distribution over IP** is **Enabled** , CFSoIP is enabled, as shown in the following example:
> 
```
switch# **show cfs status**  
> Distribution : Enabled  
> **Distribution over IP : Enabled**  
> IPv4 multicast address : 239.255.70.83  
> IPv6 multicast address : ff15::efff:4653  
> Distribution over Ethernet : Disabled
```

**Note** : On Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnects, first use the **connect nxos** command to enter the Cisco NX-OS CLI, then use the **show cfs status** command.

## 
Fixed Software 
  * Cisco has released [free software updates](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu) that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.
Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  
<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>
Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.
The [Cisco Support and Downloads page](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html) on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.
When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
### Customers Without Service Contracts
Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>
Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
### Cisco NX-OS Software
To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).
Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:
    * Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases
    * Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases
    * Enter the output of the **show version** command
After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.
Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release—for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:
Cisco NX-OS Software  Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode  MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches  Nexus 1000V Series Switches  Nexus 3000 Series Switches  Nexus 5000 Series Switches  Nexus 6000 Series Switches  Nexus 7000 Series Switches  Nexus 9000 Series Switches 
By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.
### Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches SMUs
Cisco has released the following SMUs to address this vulnerability. Customers can download the SMUs from the [Software Center](https://software.cisco.com/download/home.html) on Cisco.com.

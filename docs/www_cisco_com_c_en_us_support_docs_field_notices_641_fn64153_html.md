Bias-Free Language
### Bias-Free Language
The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality.

| --- | --- |  
| [CSCux37457](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCux37457)  | Power supply status stuck on either "ps, fail" or "ok"  |  
### Problem Description
The Power Supply Unit (PSU) failure events might not be accurately captured in the **show platform** command after boot up.
### Background
After system bootup, the PSU status can be viewed with the **show platform** command.
On all ASR1000 chassis that use Cisco IOS-XE images 3.10.7, 3.16.1a, 3.16.2, 3.16.2b, 3.17.0, and 3.17.1, the PSU status might be inaccurately displayed in these scenarios:
  * Scenario 1 - After bootup the PSU is connected and functions properly, but the **show platform** command might display as 'ps,fail'.
  * Scenario 2 - If the PSU fails or if the power cable is unplugged from the PSU, the **show platform** command might display as 'ok'.


### Problem Symptom
After bootup, the **show platform** command might incorrectly display 'ps,fail' or 'ok' with Cisco IOS-XE images 3.10.7, 3.16.1a, 3.16.2, 3.16.2b, 3.17.0 and 3.17.1
### Workaround/Solution
It is not required to create a Return Material Authorization (RMA) for the PSU. In order to fix this issue, upgrade to either of these images:
  * Cisco IOS-XE 3.16.3
  * Cisco IOS-XE 3.17.2

## New and Changed
               	 Features

The following sections describe the features that are new or have
                  		changed in this release.

### Features Available
                  	 with the Latest Cisco Unified Communications Manager Device Pack

The following sections describe features in the release which require
                     		the new firmware and the latest Cisco Unified Communications Manager Device
                     		Pack.

For information about the Cisco Unified IP Phones and the required Cisco
                     		Unified Communications Manager device packs, see the following URL:

http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/compat/devpack_comp_mtx.html

#### Enbloc Dialing

You can now place calls quicker with Enbloc Dialing. When enabled, this feature eliminates the delay often experienced when
                           dialing a phone number during the following scenarios:

On hook dialing and redialing

Speed dial and Speed dial BLF

Voice mail

Calls that are made from your Recent list

Calls that are made from your Directory

Previously users experienced a delay of up to 15 seconds when placing a call.

Administrators can find the Enbloc Dialing parameter in the Product Specific Configuration Layout section of CUCM. When enabled,
                           it overrides the T.302 timer and the entire dialed string is sent to the CUCM once the dialing is complete.

Forced Authorization Codes (FAC) or Client Matter Codes (CMC) do not support Enbloc Dialing. If you use FAC or CMC to manage
                           call access and accounting, then you cannot use this feature.

### Phone Behavior
                  	 During Times of Network Congestion

Anything that degrades network performance can affect phone voice and video quality, and in some cases, can cause a call
                        to drop. Sources of network degradation can include, but are not limited to, the following activities:

Administrative
                              				tasks, such as an internal port scan or security scan

Attacks that
                              				occur on your network, such as a Denial of Service attack

### Health-Care
                  	 Environment Use

This product is not a
                     		medical device and uses an unlicensed frequency band that is susceptible to
                     		interference from other devices or equipment.

### On-Hook Transfer Limitation in SIP Phones

When the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Transfer On-Hook Enabled field is enabled, users might report a problem with direct call transfer in SIP phones. If the user transfers the call and
                        immediately goes on hook before they hear the ring signal, the call may drop instead of being transferred.

The user needs to hear the ring signal so that they can be sure that the call is being routed.

### Ringtone Limitation During Firmware Downgrade from Release 11.0

When the phone downgrades from Firmware Release 11.0 to Firmware Release 10.3, the phone may not ring when there is an incoming
                        call. The ringtone for the line has been deleted and must be manually set in the Settings > Ringtone menu.

### Connections with the PC and SW Ports

If you only have one LAN cable at your desk, you can plug your phone into the LAN with the SW port and then connect your computer
                        into the PC port.

You can also daisy chain two phones together.  Connect the PC port of the first phone to the SW port of the second phone.

Do not connect the SW and PC ports into the LAN.

### Language Limitation

There is no localized Keyboard
                        Alphanumeric Text Entry (KATE) support for the following Asian
                        locales:

Chinese (China)

Chinese (Hong Kong)

Chinese (Taiwan)

Japanese (Japan)

Korean (Korea Republic)

The default English (United States) KATE is presented to the user instead.

For example, the phone screen will show text in Korean, but the 2 key on the keypad will display a b c 2 A B C .

## Cisco Unified Communication Manager Public Keys

To improve software integrity protection, new public keys are used to sign cop files for Cisco Unified Communications Manager
                     Release 10.0.1 and later. These cop files have "k3" in their name. To install a k3 cop file on a pre-10.0.1 Cisco Unified Communications Manager, consult the README for the
                     ciscocm.version3-keys.cop.sgn to determine if this additional cop file must first be installed on your specific Cisco Unified
                     Communications Manager version. If these keys are not present and are required, you will see the error "The selected file is not valid" when you try to install the software package.

## Unified
               	 Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer

By default, Cisco
                     		  IP Phones are set up for the English (United States) locale. To use the Cisco
                     		  IP Phones in other locales, you must install the locale-specific version of the
                     		  Unified Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer on every Cisco
                     		  Unified Communications Manager server in the cluster. The Locale Installer
                     		  installs the latest translated text for the phone user interface and
                     		  country-specific phone tones on your system so that they are available for the
                     		  Cisco IP Phones.

To access the Locale Installer required for a release, access https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html?mdfid=286037605&flowid=46245 , navigate to your phone model, and select the Unified Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer link.

For more information, see the documentation for your particular Cisco Unified Communications Manager release.

The latest
                                 			 Locale Installer may not be immediately available; continue to check the
                                 			 website for updates.

## Cisco IP Phone Documentation Updates on Cisco Unified Communications Manager

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager Self Care Portal (Release 10.0 and later) and User Options web pages (Release 9.1
                     and earlier) provide  links to the IP Phone user guides in PDF format. These user guides are stored on the Cisco Unified Communications
                     Manager and are up to date when the Cisco Unified Communications Manager release is first made available to customers.

After a Cisco Unified Communications Manager release, subsequent updates to the user guides appear only on the Cisco website.
                     The phone firmware release notes contain the applicable documentation URLs. In the web pages, updated documents display "Updated" beside the document link.

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager Device Packages and the Unified Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer
                                 do not update the English user guides on the Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

You and your users should check the Cisco website for updated user guides and download the PDF files. You can also make the
                     files available to your users on your company website.

You may want to bookmark the web pages for the phone models that are deployed in your company and send these URLs to your
                                 users.

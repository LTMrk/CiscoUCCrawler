### Release Notes for Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the IM and Presence Service Release 14SU6

First Published: March 18, 2026

# About Release Notes

This release describes new features, restrictions, and caveats for Cisco Unified Communications Manager ( Unified Communications Manager ) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service ( IM and Presence Service ) . The release notes are updated for every maintenance release but not for patches or hot fixes.

## Supported Versions

The following software versions apply to:

Unified Communications Manager Release: 14.0.1.16900-4

IM and Presence Service Release: 14.0.16900-3

### Version Compatibility Between Unified CM and the IM and Presence Service

Version compatibility depends on the IM and Presence Service deployment type. The following table outlines the options and
                        whether a release mismatch is supported between the telephony deployment and the IM and Presence Service deployment. A release
                        mismatch, if it is supported, would let you deploy your Unified Communications Manager telephony deployment and your IM and
                        Presence Service deployment using different releases.

Any respin or ES that is produced between Cisco.com releases is considered part of the previous release. For example, a Unified Communications Manager ES with a build number
                                 of 14.0.1.16[0-2]xx would be considered part of the 14SU6 (14.0.1.16901-x) release.

Deployment Type

Release Mismatch

Description

Standard Deployment of IM and Presence Service

Not supported

Unified Communications Manager and the IM and Presence Service are in the same cluster and must run the same release—a release
                                    mismatch is not supported.

Centralized Deployment of IM and Presence Service

Supported

The IM and Presence Service deployment and the telephony deployment are in different clusters and can run on different releases—a
                                    release mismatch is supported.

The IM and Presence Service central cluster also includes a standalone Unified CM publisher node for database and user provisioning.
                                             This non-telephony node must run on the same release as the IM and Presence Service.

Centralized Deployment is supported for the IM and Presence Service from Release 11.5(1)SU4 onwards.

## Documentation for this Release

For a complete list of the documentation that is available for this release, see the Documentation Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the IM and Presence Service, Release 14 .

## Installation Procedures

For information on how to install your system, see the Installation Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager and the IM and Presence Service .

## Upgrade Procedures

For information on how to upgrade to this release, see the Upgrade and Migration Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager and IM and Presence Service, Release 14 .

## New and Changed Features

There are no new features that are introduced for this release.

## Important Notes

### Deprecation of 32-Bit Windows Plugin Support for Cisco TAPI Service Provider

Cisco Unified Communications Manager does not support Cisco TAPI Service Provider (TSP) 32-bit Windows plugin. We encourage
                     you to migrate to the 64-bit plugin version of Cisco TAPI Service Provider (TSP) on supported Windows platforms.

For more information, see the following: Deprecation of 32-Bit Windows Plugin Support for Cisco TAPI Service Provider in Cisco Unified Communications Manager .

### Deprecation of Mobile Voice Access via H.323 and SIP VXML Gateways

Cisco Unified Communications Manager does not support Mobile Voice Access via H.323 and SIP VoiceXML (VXML) Gateways. We encourage
                     you to configure Unified Communications Manager with native Mobile Voice Access, which is supported starting from Unified
                     CM version 12.5 and later.

For more information, see: Deprecation of Mobile Voice Access via H.323 and SIP VXML Gateways in Cisco Unified Communications Manager .

### Simplifying Release Number Scheme

From Release 14 onwards, Cisco Unified Communications Manager has adopted the single number release plan. There will be no
                        (dot) releases like (dot five) in the past release versions. Service Update releases will be published on top of the main
                        major release 14 through the regular Software Maintenance cycle.

### SIP Secure Phone Registration

From 14SU2 release onwards, memory usage increases for SIP secure phone registrations although it does not impact the server
                        capacity in most of the deployments.

### New 2021 Signing Key

Attention

Release 14SU1 and onwards is signed with a new 2021 signing key. It is possible that you may need to install the ciscocm.enable-sha512sum-2021-signing-key-v1.0.cop.sgn
                                 COP file first if upgrading from Unified Communications Manager versions prior to Release 14. See the COP file readme for
                                 specifics.

This release also removes support for the previous signing key. If you are installing phone firmware, ensure that you use
                                 the files with k4.cop.sha512 in the name, as these files are also signed with the new signing key. Installing files signed
                                 with the previous signing key results in a "The selected file is not valid." error during installation.

### New Cisco Gateway Support

New releases of Unified Communications Manager have introduced support for the following Cisco gateways:

Cisco VG400 Analog Voice Gateway

Cisco VG410 Analog Voice Gateway (Using only the Gateway Configuration window from Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration Graphical User Interface)

Cisco VG420 Analog Voice Gateway

Cisco VG450 Analog Voice Gateway

Cisco 4461 Integrated Services Router

The following table lists supported gateway models and the initial release, by release category, where support was introduced.
                        Within each release category (for example, 11.5(x) and 12.5(x)), support for the gateway model is added as of the specified
                        release, along with later releases in that category. For these releases, you can select the gateway in the Gateway Configuration window of Unified Communications Manager.

## Installation

### Installation Requirements

Before you install the firmware release, you must ensure that your Cisco Unified
                        				Communications Manager ( Unified CM ) is running the latest device pack. After you install a device pack on the Unified CM servers in the cluster, you need to reboot all the servers.

If your Unified CM doesn't have the required device pack to support this firmware release, the firmware may not work correctly.

For information on the Unified CM Device Packs, see https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/compat/matrix/CMDP_BK_CCBDA741_00_cucm-device-package-compatibility-matrix.html .

### Install the Firmware Release on Cisco Unified Communications Manager

Before using the phone firmware release on the Cisco Unified Communications Manager, you must install the latest Cisco Unified
                        Communications Manager firmware on all Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers in the cluster.

Go to the following URL:

https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html?mdfid=284883944&i=rm

## Limitations and Restrictions

### Manufacturing Installed Certificate Signature and SHA-256 Support

The manufacturing installed certificate(MIC) signature has been updated from SHA-128 with RSA to SHA-256 with RSA. You must
                        update and install the new SHA-2 certificates on the Cisco Unified Communications Manager for secure mode to function. You
                        can download the new certificate from http://www.cisco.com/security/pki/certs/cmca2.cer .

Cisco Unified Communications Manager

Cisco Unified Survivable Remote Site Telephony

Cisco Secure Access Control System

Cisco Identity Services Engine

For additional information about SHA-2 use and support, see Security Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager ( https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/unified-communications/unified-communications-manager-callmanager/products-maintenance-guides-list.html ).

### Phone Behavior
                  	 During Times of Network Congestion

Anything that degrades network performance can affect phone audio and, in some cases, can cause a call to drop. Sources of
                        network degradation can include, but are not limited to, the following activities:

Administrative
                              				tasks, such as an internal port scan or security scan

Attacks that
                              				occur on your network, such as a Denial of Service attack

### Health-Care
                  	 Environment Use

This product is not a
                     		medical device and uses an unlicensed frequency band that is susceptible to
                     		interference from other devices or equipment.

### On-Hook Transfer Limitation in SIP Phones

When the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Transfer On-Hook Enabled field is enabled, users might report a problem with direct call transfer in SIP phones. If the user transfers the call and
                        immediately goes on hook before they hear the ring signal, the call may drop instead of being transferred.

The user needs to hear the ring signal so that they can be sure that the call is being routed.

### Ringtone Limitation During Firmware Downgrade from Release 11.0

When the phone downgrades from Firmware Release 11.0 to Firmware Release 10.3, the phone may not ring when there is an incoming
                        call. The ringtone for the line has been deleted and must be manually set in the Settings > Ringtone menu.

### Connections with the PC and SW Ports

If you only have one LAN cable at your desk, you can plug your phone into the LAN with the SW port and then connect your computer
                        into the PC port.

You can also daisy chain two phones together.  Connect the PC port of the first phone to the SW port of the second phone.

Do not connect the SW and PC ports into the LAN.

### Language Limitation

There is no localized Keyboard
                        Alphanumeric Text Entry (KATE) support for the following Asian
                        locales:

Chinese (China)

Chinese (Hong Kong)

Chinese (Taiwan)

Japanese (Japan)

Korean (Korea Republic)

The default English (United States) KATE is presented to the user instead.

For example, the phone screen will show text in Korean, but the 2 key on the keypad will display a b c 2 A B C .

### Softkey Templates and Video Mode

You can't configure softkey
                        				templates for Video mode on the Cisco IP Phone 7800 Series phones. If a softkey
                        				appears on the phone, then it will not function correctly.

## Cisco Unified Communication Manager Public Keys

To improve software integrity protection, new public keys are used to sign cop files for Cisco Unified Communications Manager
                     Release 10.0.1 and later. These cop files have "k3" in their name. To install a k3 cop file on a pre-10.0.1 Cisco Unified Communications Manager, consult the README for the
                     ciscocm.version3-keys.cop.sgn to determine if this additional cop file must first be installed on your specific Cisco Unified
                     Communications Manager version. If these keys are not present and are required, you will see the error "The selected file is not valid" when you try to install the software package.

## Unified
               	 Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer

By default, Cisco
                     		  IP Phones are set up for the English (United States) locale. To use the Cisco
                     		  IP Phones in other locales, you must install the locale-specific version of the
                     		  Unified Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer on every Cisco
                     		  Unified Communications Manager server in the cluster. The Locale Installer
                     		  installs the latest translated text for the phone user interface and
                     		  country-specific phone tones on your system so that they are available for the
                     		  Cisco IP Phones.

To access the Locale Installer required for a release, access https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html?mdfid=286037605&flowid=46245 , navigate to your phone model, and select the Unified Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer link.

For more information, see the documentation for your particular Cisco Unified Communications Manager release.

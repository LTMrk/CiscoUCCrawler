## Resumen

## Descripción
Retrieve Barge In Call Settings for a Workspace.

Barge In, when enabled, allows you to use the Feature Access Code (FAC) on your desk phone to answer someone else’s phone call or barge in on a call they’ve already answered.

This API requires a full, read-only or location administrator auth token with a scope of `spark-admin:workspaces_read` or a user auth token with a scope of `spark:workspaces_read` to read workspace settings.

## Parámetros

- `orgId` [query] (string): ID of the organization within which the workspace resides. Only admin users of another organization (such as partners) may use this parameter as the default is the same organization as the token used to access the API.

## Ejemplo de invocación
```bash
curl -X GET '/telephony/config/workspaces/<workspaceId>/bargeIn' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>'
```

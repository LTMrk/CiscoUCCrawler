## Limitations and Restrictions

### Phone Behavior
                  	 During Times of Network Congestion

Anything that degrades network performance can affect phone audio and video quality, and in some cases, can cause a call to
                        drop. Sources of network degradation can include, but are not limited to, the following activities:

Administrative
                              				tasks, such as an internal port scan or security scan

Attacks that
                              				occur on your network, such as a Denial of Service attack

### Firmware
                  	 Limitation of Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 with Cisco IP Conference Phone
                  	 8832 PoE Injector

The Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 PoE Injector is supported on phones running firmware release 12.0(1)SR2 and later. Confirm that the latest firmware release is installed
                     on the Cisco Unified Communications Manager before you connect the Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 with the PoE injector to
                     the network.

If you are not using the latest firmware release, then your phone may downgrade to an earlier firmware release, and lose the
                     network connectivity.

To recover a phone that has lost network connectivity, update Device Defaults for the Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 to 8832-sip.12-0-1SR2-2.k3.cop.sgn or later in Cisco Unified Communications Manager Administration. Then, perform one of the following steps:

Force the phone to reboot from the alternate software image that supports the PoE Injector. To reboot your phone from the
                           backup image, see Boot Up the Conference Phone from the Alternate Partition section in the Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager .

Install and use the Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 Ethernet Injector on the phone. This allows you to regain network connectivity. After the phone has upgraded to the latest firmware, you can
                           again use the Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 PoE Injector .

### Health-Care
                  	 Environment Use

This product is not a
                     		medical device and uses an unlicensed frequency band that is susceptible to
                     		interference from other devices or equipment.

### Language Limitation

There is no localized Keyboard
                        Alphanumeric Text Entry (KATE) support for the following Asian
                        locales:

Chinese (China)

Chinese (Hong Kong)

Chinese (Taiwan)

Japanese (Japan)

Korean (Korea Republic)

The default English (United States) KATE is presented to the user instead.

For example, the phone screen will show text in Korean, but the 2 key on the keypad will display a b c 2 A B C .

### Wireless Microphone Battery Limitation

When you press the Show detail softkey, the Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 occasionally displays a false Bad battery warning. This issue occurs when you quickly reseat the wireless microphone 20 consecutive times or more.

To recover from this issue, perform the following steps in order:

Remove the microphone from the charging cradle.

Press the Mute button for approximately 10 seconds or until the microphone LED stops blinking white. Then, reseat the microphone on the
                              charging cradle.

Restart the phone by disconnecting and reconnecting the Cisco IP Conference Phone 8832 Power Adapter.

The Bad battery warning on the phone screen disappears and the current battery status appears. If you do not see the battery status, then
                              the microphone battery has deteriorated and you must replace it.

## Cisco Unified Communication Manager Public Keys

To improve software integrity protection, new public keys are used to sign cop files for Cisco Unified Communications Manager
                     Release 10.0.1 and later. These cop files have "k3" in their name. To install a k3 cop file on a pre-10.0.1 Cisco Unified Communications Manager, consult the README for the
                     ciscocm.version3-keys.cop.sgn to determine if this additional cop file must first be installed on your specific Cisco Unified
                     Communications Manager version. If these keys are not present and are required, you will see the error "The selected file is not valid" when you try to install the software package.

## Unified
               	 Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer

By default, Cisco
                     		  IP Phones are set up for the English (United States) locale. To use the Cisco
                     		  IP Phones in other locales, you must install the locale-specific version of the
                     		  Unified Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer on every Cisco
                     		  Unified Communications Manager server in the cluster. The Locale Installer
                     		  installs the latest translated text for the phone user interface and
                     		  country-specific phone tones on your system so that they are available for the
                     		  Cisco IP Phones.

To access the Locale Installer required for a release, access https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html?mdfid=286037605&flowid=46245 , navigate to your phone model, and select the Unified Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer link.

For more information, see the documentation for your particular Cisco Unified Communications Manager release.

The latest
                                 			 Locale Installer may not be immediately available; continue to check the
                                 			 website for updates.

## Cisco IP Phone Documentation Updates on Cisco Unified Communications Manager

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager Self Care Portal (Release 10.0 and later) and User Options web pages (Release 9.1
                     and earlier) provide  links to the IP Phone user guides in PDF format. These user guides are stored on the Cisco Unified Communications
                     Manager and are up to date when the Cisco Unified Communications Manager release is first made available to customers.

After a Cisco Unified Communications Manager release, subsequent updates to the user guides appear only on the Cisco website.
                     The phone firmware release notes contain the applicable documentation URLs. In the web pages, updated documents display "Updated" beside the document link.

The Cisco Unified Communications Manager Device Packages and the Unified Communications Manager Endpoints Locale Installer
                                 do not update the English user guides on the Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

You and your users should check the Cisco website for updated user guides and download the PDF files. You can also make the
                     files available to your users on your company website.

You may want to bookmark the web pages for the phone models that are deployed in your company and send these URLs to your
                                 users.

                              for the JVDI Agent and the JVDI Client.

Go to Help > Show connection status

In the Connection Status window, click JVDI Details .

JVDI Client version

If the JVDI Client version is 12.5 or 12.1, the client version doesn't appear until after the softphone connects.

JVDI Agent version

Virtual Channel status indicates whether communication between the JVDI Client and Cisco Jabber is successful.

SIP status indicates whether SIP communication with Cisco Unified Communications Manager is successful.

Softphone CTI status indicates whether CTI communication is successful.

If the SIP status is Connected , but the Softphone CTI status is Not connected , check the CTI configuration in CUCM.

To see detailed diagnostic information for Cisco Jabber , press Ctrl +Shift +D .

Scroll down the list of packages and look for Cisco JVDI Client .

## Verify That VXC Is Running on the Thin Client

Search the running programs for vxc .

ps -ef | grep -r vxc

```
admin@LWT44d3ca76ba19:~> ps -ef |grep -r vxc

thinuser 6536 1 0 Mar14 ? 00:07:43 /bin/bash /usr/bin/pidrun.sh -c run_vxc.sh -a -m -o /var/log/cisco/vxcConsole.log -e /var/log/cisco/vxcError.log

thinuser 6538 6536 0 Mar14 ? 00:00:00 /bin/bash /usr/bin/run_vxc.sh -m

thinuser 6547 6538 8 Mar14 ? 13:02:16 vxc -m

## Call Control Is Lost After a Network Failure

Users  see a prompt to reconnect to their hosted virtual desktops (HVDs). After the users reconnect, Cisco Jabber call control features do not work.

This problem can occur if the thin client loses network connectivity.

To resolve this issue, have the users exit Cisco Jabber and disconnect from their HVDs. Next they can log back in to their HVDs and sign back in to Cisco Jabber to restore call control.

## Call Is Lost After HVD Disconnection

Users receive a prompt to log back in to their hosted virtual desktops (HVD) during an active call, and the call drops. The
                              other party to the call has  no indication that the call has ended, except the line is silent.

This issue can occur if the  connection between the thin client and the  HVD drops, causing a temporary loss of registration
                              and call control.

To work around this issue, users can call the other party back. If the other party is not available, users can send an instant
                              message (IM).
